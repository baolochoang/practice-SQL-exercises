## DESCRIPTION
Patient Support Analysis (Part 2)

UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.
Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are classified into various categories, but some calls cannot be neatly categorised. These uncategorised calls are labeled as “n/a”, or are left empty when the support agent does not enter anything into the call category field.
Write a query to calculate the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place. For example, 45.0, 48.5, 57.7.

callers Table:

| Column Name         | Type          |
|---------------------|---------------|
| policy_holder_id    | integer       |
| case_id             | varchar       |
| call_category       | varchar       |
| call_date           | timestamp     |
| call_duration_secs  | integer       |

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION

### High-level Overview

### CODE

**Method #1: With CTE**
```sql
WITH uncategorised_callers AS (
  SELECT COUNT(case_id) AS uncategorised_calls
  FROM callers
  WHERE call_category IS NULL
    OR call_category = 'n/a'
)

SELECT
  ROUND(100.0 * uncategorised_calls / SELECT COUNT(*) FROM callers, 1) AS uncategorised_call_pct
FROM uncategorised_callers;
```

**Method #2: Without CTE**
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SELECT COUNT(*) FROM callers, 1) AS uncategorised_call_pct
FROM callers
WHERE call_category IS NULL or call_category = 'n/a'
```

**Method #3: Using Aggregation and CASE**
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(
        100.0 * SUM(
            CASE WHEN call_category IS NULL OR call_category = 'n/a' THEN 1
            ELSE 0
            END) / COUNT(*), 1
        ) AS uncategorised_call_pct
FROM callers
```

## DESCRIPTION
3-Topping Pizzas [McKinsey SQL Interview Question]
You’re a consultant for a major pizza chain that will be running a promotion where all 3-topping pizzas will be sold for a fixed price, and are trying to understand the costs involved.

Given a list of pizza toppings, consider all the possible 3-topping pizzas, and print out the total cost of those 3 toppings. Sort the results with the highest total cost on the top followed by pizza toppings in ascending order.

Break ties by listing the ingredients in alphabetical order, starting from the first ingredient, followed by the second and third.

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION
Để giải quyết được bài toán này chúng ta cần biết cách tạo ra tổ hợp không trùng lặp:
- 
### High-level Overview

### CODE

Method #1: Sử dụng implicit join (cross join) để tính tổ hợp + các điều kiện để loại bỏ các tổ hợp trùng lặp thỏa mãn yêu cầu.
```sql
-- Let's split the problem into 3 slices.
    -- - Get every possible combination of 3-topping pizzas
    -- - Discard rows with duplicate toppings and arrange them according to alphabetical order
    -- - Order output by lowest to highest cost

-- Step 1: 3-Topping Combinations
-- Step 2: Discard duplicates and arrange them alphabetically
-- Step 3: Return desired output

SELECT 
  CONCAT(p1.topping_name, ',', p2.topping_name, ',', p3.topping_name) AS pizza,
  p1.ingredient_cost + p2.ingredient_cost + p3.ingredient_cost AS total_cost
FROM pizza_toppings AS p1
CROSS JOIN
  pizza_toppings AS p2,
  pizza_toppings AS p3
WHERE p1.topping_name < p2.topping_name
  AND p2.topping_name < p3.topping_name
ORDER BY total_cost DESC, pizza;
```

Method #2: Using INNER JOIN 
```sql
-- Step 1: Join the tables thrice horizontally
-- Step 2: Combine pizza toppings and add the ingredients
SELECT 
  CONCAT(p1.topping_name, ',', p2.topping_name, ',', p3.topping_name) AS pizza,
  p1.ingredient_cost + p2.ingredient_cost + p3.ingredient_cost AS total_cost
FROM pizza_toppings AS p1
INNER JOIN pizza_toppings AS p2
  ON p1.topping_name < p2.topping_name 
INNER JOIN pizza_toppings AS p3
  ON p2.topping_name < p3.topping_name 
ORDER BY total_cost DESC, pizza;
```

## LESSONS
- CROSS JOIN + CONDITIONS IN JOIN || WHERE để tạo ra tổ hợp theo mong muốn
- CONCAT() hoặc CONCAT_WS()

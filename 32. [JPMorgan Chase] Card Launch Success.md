## DESCRIPTION
Card Launch Success

Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.
Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.
Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.

## LESSONS
Mấu chốt của bài là việc mình xác định được như thế nào tháng ra mắt.
Và hiểu rõ kết quả mong muốn --> ví dụ, đối với các bài toán lấy ra các giá trị theo vị trí -> mà vị trí này được sắp xếp theo tổ hợp các điều kiện -> sử dụng OVER (PARTITION BY)

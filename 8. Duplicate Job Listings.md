## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION
Method #1: Using CTE
```sql
WITH job_count_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description, 
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
  FROM job_listings
  GROUP BY company_id, title, description
  HAVING COUNT(job_id) > 1
)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS duplicate_companies
FROM job_count_cte; 
```

Method #2: Using Subquery 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) AS duplicate_companies
FROM (
  SELECT 
    company_id, 
    title, 
    description, 
    COUNT(job_id) AS job_count
  FROM job_listings
  GROUP BY company_id, title, description
) AS job_count_cte
WHERE job_count > 1;
```

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION

### High-level Overview
Step 1: Join the tables to obtain the caller's and receiver's country informaiton
Step 2: Count the international calls and the total number of calls
Step 3: Calculate the percentage of international calls


### CODE
**Method #1: Using CTE**
```sql
SELECT 
  100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM phone_calls) AS international_call_pct
FROM (
  select
    pcs.caller_id,
    pcs.receiver_id,
    pif_1.country_id AS caller_country,
    pif_2.country_id AS receiver_country
  from phone_calls AS pcs
  LEFT JOIN phone_info as pif_1
    ON pcs.caller_id = pif_1.caller_id
  LEFT JOIN phone_info as pif_2
    ON pcs.receiver_id = pif_2.caller_id
) AS international_calls
WHERE caller_country != receiver_country
```

**Method #2: Using Filter**
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(
        100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (
            WHERE caller.country_id <> receiver.country_id)
        /COUNT(*), 1) AS international_calls_pct
FROM phone_calls AS calls
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS caller
    ON calls.caller_id = caller.caller_id
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS receiver
    ON calls.receiver_id = receiver.caller_id
```

**Method #3: Using <> is a condition**
```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(
    100.0 * SUM(CASE
      WHEN caller.country_id <> receiver.country_id THEN 1 ELSE NULL END)
    /COUNT(*) ,1) AS international_call_pct
FROM phone_calls AS calls
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS caller
  ON calls.caller_id = caller.caller_id
LEFT JOIN phone_info AS receiver
  ON calls.receiver_id = receiver.caller_id;
```

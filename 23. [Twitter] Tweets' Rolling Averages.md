## DESCRIPTION
Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

Step 1: Calculate the average tweet count for each user (rolling average function)
However, this is not what we need as we want to calculate the rolling average over a 3-day period. 
To achieve this, we add the expression ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW to the window function.

Step 2: Calculate the rolling average tweet count for each user over a 3-day period
`ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg`

Step 3: Round the rolling average tweet count to 2 decimal points
`ROUND(X, 2)`

## SOLUTION
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  tweet_date,
  ROUND(AVG(tweet_count) OVER (
    PARTITION BY user_id
    ORDER BY tweet_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS rolling_avg_3d
FROM tweets;
```

## LESSONS

- AGGREGATION FUNCTION + WINDOW FUNCTION --> **ROLLING AGGREGATION** FUNCTION
- The difference of AGGREGATION vs ROLLING AGGREGATION
```sql
### Rolling aggregation function (aggregation function + window function)
SELECT
  column1,
  column2,
  AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_column]
    ORDER BY order_column
    [ROWS | RANGE BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW]
  ) AS rolling_aggregate
FROM table_name;

-- EXAMPLES --
1. Using ROWS
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS rolling_sum_3d
FROM sales;

2. Using RANGE
SELECT
  date,
  amount,
  MAX(amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '7' DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS rolling_max_7d
FROM sales;

### Aggregation function
SELECT AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name) FROM table_name;
SELECT grouping_column, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column_name) FROM table_name GROUP BY grouping_column;
```

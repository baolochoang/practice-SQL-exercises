## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION
```sql
-- Bước 1: Tính tổng doanh thu cho từng sản phẩm (danh mục)
WITH product_totals AS (
  SELECT
    category,
    product,
    SUM(spend) AS total_spend
  FROM product_spend  
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date::date) = 2022
  GROUP BY category, product
),
-- Bước 2: Xếp hạng các sản phẩm theo tổng chi tiêu trong mỗi danh mục
ranked_products AS (
  SELECT
    category,
    product,
    total_spend,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY total_spend DESC) AS rank_spend
  FROM product_totals
)
-- Bước 3: Lọc hai sản phẩm có doanh thu cao nhất trong mỗi danh mục
SELECT
  category,
  product,
  total_spend
FROM ranked_products
WHERE rank_spend <= 2
ORDER BY category, rank_spend;
```

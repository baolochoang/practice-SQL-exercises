## DESCRIPTION
You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION
Step 1: Calculate the weighted average of items per order
```
SELECT 
  SUM(item_count*order_occurrences)
    /SUM(order_occurrences) AS mean
FROM items_per_order;
```
`it's important to note that item_count and order_occurences` are of integer type by default 
, which means that division will return an integer result.
=> to ensure that the output is rounded to 1 decimal place, we can cast either column to decimal type using ::DECIMAL or CAST(field AS decimal)

Step 2: Round results to 1 decimal place

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(
    SUM(item_count::DECIMAL*order_occurrences)
    /SUM(order_occurrences)
  ,1) AS mean
FROM items_per_order;
```

## LESSONS
1. FROM the desired output => Needs cast either column to a desired type

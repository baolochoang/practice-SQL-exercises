## DESCRIPTION
CVS Health is analyzing its pharmacy sales data, and how well different products are selling in the market. Each drug is exclusively manufactured by a single manufacturer.

Write a query to identify the manufacturers associated with the drugs that resulted in losses for CVS Health and calculate the total amount of losses incurred.

Output the manufacturer's name, the number of drugs associated with losses, and the total losses in absolute value. Display the results sorted in descending order with the highest losses displayed at the top.

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS
Write a query to **identify** the manufacturers associated with the drugs (1) **that resulted in losses** for CVS Health 
and calculate the **total amount of losses** incurred.

Output **the manufacturer's name**, **the number of drugs** associated with losses, and the **total losses** (2) in absolute value. 
Display the results sorted in descending order with the highest losses displayed at the top.

DESIRED TABLE
| manufacturer | drug_count | total_loss
| the manufacturer's name | the number of drugs | total losses

From (2), we have: 
```text
Step 1: calculate total profit or loss for each manufacturer
total profit (total loss) = total sales - total Cost of Goods sold
--> total_sales - cogs AS net_value

Step 2: filter for drugs makings losses
WHERE total_sales - cogs <= 0
```

From (1), we have: 
```text
Step 3: Obtain count of unprofitable drugs and total losses for each manufacturer
--> [COLS] COUNT(drug) AS drug_count, SUM(total_sales - cogs) ... GROUP BY manufacturer;
Step 4: Convert total loss to absolute value and sort output
--> ABS(SUM(total_sales - cogs))
```


## SOLUTION
```sql
SELECT
  manufacturer,
  COUNT(drug) AS drug_count,
  ABS(SUM(total_sales - cogs)) AS total_loss
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE 
  total_sales - cogs <= 0
GROUP BY manufacturer
ORDER BY total_loss DESC;
```

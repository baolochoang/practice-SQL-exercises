## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION

### High-level Overview


### CODE
```sql
WITH highest_prices AS (
  SELECT 
    ticker,
    TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon-YYYY') AS highest_mth,
    MAX(open) AS highest_open,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY open DESC) AS row_num
  FROM stock_prices
  GROUP BY ticker, TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon-YYYY'), open
),
lowest_prices AS (
  SELECT 
    ticker,
    TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon-YYYY') AS lowest_mth,
    MIN(open) AS lowest_open,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY open) AS row_num
  FROM stock_prices
  GROUP BY ticker, TO_CHAR(date, 'Mon-YYYY'), open
)

SELECT
  highest.ticker,
  highest.highest_mth,
  highest.highest_open,
  lowest.lowest_mth,
  lowest.lowest_open
FROM highest_prices as highest
INNER JOIN lowest_prices AS lowest
  ON highest.ticker = lowest.ticker
  AND highest.row_num = 1 -- Highest open price
  AND lowest.row_num = 1 -- Lowest open price
ORDER BY highest.ticker;
```

## LESSONS
- Sử dụng GROUP By theo các tiêu chí phản ánh đúng kết quả tìm kiếm như GROUP BY (ticker, date)
- Sử dụng JOIN với các điều kiện đi kèm để lấy các dữ liệu cần thiết

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION

### High-level Overview


### CODE

Method #1: Using CTE + RANK()
```sql
WITH latest_transactions_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    transaction_date, 
    user_id, 
    product_id, 
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY user_id 
      ORDER BY transaction_date DESC) AS transaction_rank 
  FROM user_transactions) 
  
SELECT 
  transaction_date, 
  user_id,
  COUNT(product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM latest_transactions_cte
WHERE transaction_rank = 1 
GROUP BY transaction_date, user_id
ORDER BY transaction_date;
```

Mehod #2: Using CTE + MAX()
```sql
WITH latest_transactions AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        MAX(transaction_date) AS most_recent_date
    FROM
        user_transactions
    GROUP BY
        user_id
)

SELECT
    lt.most_recent_date,
    lt.user_id,
    COUNT(ut.product_id) AS num_products
FROM
    latest_transactions lt
JOIN
    user_transactions ut ON lt.user_id = ut.user_id AND lt.most_recent_date = ut.transaction_date
GROUP BY
    lt.most_recent_date,
    lt.user_id
ORDER BY
    lt.most_recent_date;
```

## LESSONS
Method #1 ngắn gọn hơn và dễ hiểu hơn nhưng yêu cầu phải biết đến RANK()

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION

Method #1: Using CTE
```sql
WITH num_completed_orders_per_user AS (
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(order_id) as num_completed_orders
  FROM trades
  WHERE status = 'Completed'
  GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT city, SUM(num_completed_orders_per_user.num_completed_orders) as total_orders
FROM 
  users
INNER JOIN 
  num_completed_orders_per_user
ON
  users.user_id = num_completed_orders_per_user.user_id
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

Method #2: Not using CTE 
```sql
SELECT
    users.city,
    COUNT(trades.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM trades
INNER JOIN users
    ON trades.user_id = users.user_id
WHERE trades.status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY users.city
ORDER BY total_orders DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```

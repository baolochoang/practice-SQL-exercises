## DESCRIPTION
Y-on-Y Growth Rate [Wayfair SQL Interview Question]
Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products. Write a query to calculate the year-on-year growth rate for the total spend of each product, grouping the results by product ID.
The output should include the year in ascending order, product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend and year-on-year growth percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.
### user_transactions Table:
| Column Name       | Type       |
|-------------------|------------|
| transaction_id    | integer    |
| product_id        | integer    |
| spend             | decimal    |
| transaction_date  | datetime   |

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION

### High-level Overview

### CODE
**Method #1: Using CTE (Only product_id and Only spend)**
```sql
WITH yearly_spend_cte AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS year,
        product_id,
        spend AS curr_year_spend,
        LAG(spend, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY product_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date)) AS prev_year_spend
    FROM user_transactions
)
SELECT
    year,
    product_id,
    curr_year_spend,
    prev_year_spend,
    ROUNT(100.0 * (curr_year_spend - prev_year_spend) / prev_year_spend, 2) AS yoy_rate
FROM yearly_spend_cte
```

**Method #2: Using Self-join**
```sql

WITH cte AS (
  SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS year, 
    product_id, 
    spend
  FROM user_transactions
)

SELECT c1.year, c1.product_id, c1.spend AS curr_year_spend, 
      c2.spend AS prev_year_spend, 
      ROUND(100.0 * (c1.spend - c2.spend) / c2.spend, 2) AS yoy_rate
FROM cte c1
LEFT JOIN cte c2
  ON c1.product_id = c2.product_id 
    AND c1.year - c2.year = 1
ORDER BY c1.product_id, c1.year
```

**Method #3: Get the total spending for each product for each year ()**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT product_id,
    SUM(spend) AS spend,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS year
  FROM user_transactions
  GROUP BY product_id, year
)

SELECT a.year,
  a.product_id,
  a.spend AS curr_year_spend,
  b.spend AS prev_year_spend,
  ROUND( ((a.spend - b.spend) / b.spend) * 100 , 2) AS yoy_rate
FROM cte AS a -- current year table
LEFT JOIN cte AS b  -- previous year table
ON a.product_id = b.product_id
  AND (a.year -1) = b.year
ORDER BY product_id, year
```

## LESSONS
Sử dụng LEAD và LAG trong việc lấy các giá trị sau và trước giá trị hiện tại. 
Ví dụ: 
- dữ liệu có: curr_year_spend --> muốn lấy giá trị của spend truong những năm trước đó
- dữ liệu có: prev_year_spend --> muốn lấy giá trị của spend trong những năm tsiêp theo
Cú pháp tổng quát khi sử dụng LEAD/LAG:
- LEAD: `LEAD(value_expression [,offset] [,default]) OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)`
- LAG: `LAG(value_expression [,offset] [,default]) OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY sort_expression)`
Trong đó: 
  - offset -> là bước dịch chuyển
  - default -> giá trị trả về mặc định nếu không tìm thấy giá trị

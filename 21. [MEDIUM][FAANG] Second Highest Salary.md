## DESCRIPTION
Imagine you're an HR analyst at a tech company tasked with analyzing employee salaries. Your manager is keen on understanding the pay distribution and asks you to determine the second highest salary among all employees.

It's possible that multiple employees may share the same second-highest salary. In case of duplicate, display the salary only once.

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS

## SOLUTION
**Method #1: Using Subquery + ROW_NUMBER()**
```sql
SELECT 
  salary AS second_highest_salary
FROM (
  SELECT
    salary,
    num_empls,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num
  FROM (
    SELECT
      salary,
      COUNT(employee_id) AS num_empls
    FROM employee
    GROUP BY salary
  ) AS stat_empls
) AS ranked_empls
WHERE row_num = 2;
```

**Method #2: Simple way** 
Step 1: Find the highest salary
Step 2: Find the highest second salary

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary < (
  SELECT MAX(salary)
  FROM employee
);

```

**Method #3: With CTE**
```sql
WITH highest_salary_cte AS (
  SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
  FROM employee
)

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employee
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT highest_salary
    FROM highest_salary_cte
);
```

## LESSONS
- Simplest thinking
- More specifically, carefully analyze the main keywords of the problem
--> the highest second salary => Method #2.
